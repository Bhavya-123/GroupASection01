## Project Description
Our project will help the Mabel Cook Recruitment and Visitors Center to keep track of their staff both in and out of the center through GPS, store student information for recruiters, and clock-in and clock-out information of their staff based on a digital clock. The final outcome of the project would be a single application which would run on a mobile platform with all the above features mentioned. All the features are accommodated in different sections on the dashboard of the mobile app.
